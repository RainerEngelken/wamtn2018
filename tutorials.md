# Tutorials

The tutorials will be held prior to the main meeting on June 26, 2018 run from 9am till 5pm to introduce students and postdocs into the mathematical techniques employed in computational neuroscience. 

There will be three tutorial given, each of approximately 2.5 hours. Each tutorial will include 1.2-2 hours of theoretical class, and 30-60 minutes of hands-on problem solving or coding examples.

## Tentative program
- Dynamics in networks with excitatory and inhibitory balance (Farzad Farkhooi)
- Quantifying chaos in neural circuits (Rainer Engelken)
- The dynamical phase space of large recurrent neural networks (Jonathan Kadmon)
